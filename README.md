# Interview Prep
Hello, and welcome! to my interview-prep repository.
Here, you can watch me struggle with leetcode and and see some randome things I made but didn't know where else to put them.  

Note that many of the files contained don't have a main function; [leetcode](leetcode.com/problems) has a test harness set up that allows you to just write the important code. Generally if you see a main function, I was struggling with it and wanted to test it locally.
